Project description:
The motivation behind this project was to create a site that would allow its visitors to find events based on holiday and location. This would make it easier not just for locals to find things to do, but people that are traveling would also be able to find events in advance so that they can plan their upcoming trips. There was a lot of trial and error when it came to this project because you have several different people at different levels when it comes to coding, so there was a lot of editing of the code and changing of ideas to get the site the way that we wanted it to be. To complete this we used several different technologies. We used VS Code to build the code, git hub as our repository so that we could share our code with each other and to deploy the site, but more than anything we used google to help perfect the code. There were several challenges that we faced but the biggest challenge that we faced was getting the correct events to populate based on the holiday chosen. Although we could get the API to fetch the events, we were unable to get them to populate when and where we wanted. With that being said the biggest success would be finding the specific JavaScript code that allowed it to work the way we wanted it to. 

Future development: 
This application can be taken to the next level with future development and quite a few things immediately come to mind. We ran into trouble with a few different APIs until we found
SeatGeek, however, an API that is able to provide more local events and not just the big concerts and sporting events would add to the hometown feel of celebrating a holiday in your community. That would elevate some of the other features such as our state and city tabs on the navbar that can filter down what you might be looking for. Right now, it only populates bigger events so a lot of states and cities would be completely empty in that filter. We tried EventBrite but their API stopped populating events in 2019 so a big step in future development would be to make this accessible to smaller cities and towns. The new Broadway show in New York City is nice to find but we'd also like someone in Bozeman, Montana to be able to find downtown celebrations for Independence Day.
